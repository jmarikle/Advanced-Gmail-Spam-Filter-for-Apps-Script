/*
 * This rules file serves as a template for how rules should be
 * supplied to the filter.  Each rules is an array with one to two
 * values.  The first value is the pattern as a string.
 *
 *   e.g. [ "wish\\.com" ]
 *
 * Notice that the litteral dot needs to be escaped.  In order to
 * escape a character in regex, you can use a backslash.  This file
 * requires a double backslash because that is also the escape
 * character in JSON.
 *
 * Flags can be supplied as well.  The second item in a rule array
 * represents theses flags.
 *
 *   e.g. [ "[a-z0-9]yelp\\.com/", "i" ]
